# Booking System - Concert and Event Ticket Management  

This project is a web application that allows users to purchase and manage tickets for concerts and events online. It is built with a **React frontend**, a **Node.js/Express backend**, and a **PostgreSQL database**. The entire application is containerized with **Docker** to simplify deployment and execution.  

The goal is to provide an intuitive and efficient platform where event organizers can easily manage ticket sales, and users can seamlessly book their seats. ðŸš€
